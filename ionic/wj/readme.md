# Body

Body is a tasting term used to to group wines by their amount of 'wieght', the sensation of fullness.  It is measured from light body to full body. Think of the distinction between skimmed and whole milk milk, which can be tasted by identifying the body. Milk will taste fuller the more fat there is in it. As for wine, our taste receptors are susceptible to acidity, alcohol, sweetness, and tannin. Each characteristic adds to the wine body in a different way:

Acidity reduces the body, and as such a wine that is high in acidity is interpreted as fresh and light.

Alcohol increases a wine's body. For this reason, wines with higher alcohol content (including fortified wines) taste fuller-bodied than those with lower alcohol content.

Sweet wines typically taste fuller-bodied than dry wines. It's also why some dry wines frequently retain a trace of sweetness to provide body.

Tannin gives wine more body. Red wines typically taste more full-bodied than white wines because they contain tannin while white wines do not.

There are other techniques to increase the body of a wine. A winemaker could opt to age in oak barrels or employ an oxidative wine aging process.

While tasting a wine focus on the body, but understand that a low body wine does not mean a low quality wine.  However a full-bodied wine will bake a bigger impression during tasting resulting in a tendancy to over state the quality of the wine.


# Sweetness

Sweetness in wine is called residual sugar, the unfermented grape sugars left over in the wine after fermentation. The perceved levels of sweetness are influenced by alchohol, acidity and tannins in the wine. A wine high in alchohol, but low in sugar can seem sweet.  While another wine that is high in acidity and residual sugar can appear dry.

The following terms are used by most professionals to describe wine sweetness levels:
Bone-dry: O calories per serving (<1 g/L)
Dry: 0-6 calories per serving (1-17 g/L)
Off-Dry: 6-21 calories per serving (17-35 g/L)
Medium Sweet: 21-72 calories per serving (35-120 g/L)
Sweet: 72+ calories per serving (>120 g/L)

Our palates are not particularly sensitive at tasting sugar. Dry-tasting wines often contain up to 17 g/L of residual sugar, which is 10 additional calories/carbs per serving.
